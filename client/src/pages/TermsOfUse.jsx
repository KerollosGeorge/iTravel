        <p className="mb-4">
          These terms of use ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and
          conditions of your use of the [iTravel.com] website ("Website" or
          "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively,
          "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between you ("User",
          "you" or "your") and [iTravel] ("[iTravel]", "we", "us" or "our"). By
          accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you
          have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
          Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a
          business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
          authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the
          terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do
          not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
          Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and
          use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a
          contract between you and [iTravel], even though it is electronic and
          is not physically signed by you and [Your Company Name], and it
          governs your use of the Website and Services.

          Accounts and membership
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for
          maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible
          for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
          taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to,
          monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using
          the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may
          result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify
          us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
          security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
          including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
          omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
          part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of
          this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage
          our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the
          foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the Services. We may
          block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent
          further registration.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">User content</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you
          submit on the Website in the course of using the Service. You shall
          have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity,
          legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property
          ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but have
          no obligation to, monitor and review Content on the Website submitted
          or created using our Services by you. You grant us permission to
          access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and
          perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the
          purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of
          those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the
          obligation, to, in our sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content
          that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in
          any way harmful or objectionable.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Billing and payments</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
          the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
          charge is due and payable. Where Services are subject to a
          subscription period, you may be billed in advance on a recurring basis
          on the start date of each subscription period. If, in our judgment,
          your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you
          to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo
          identification, andpossibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the
          account used to purchase the Services. We reserve the right to change
          products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to
          refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion,
          limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per
          order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the
          same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
          the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a
          change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by
          contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at
          the time the order was made.

          Cancellation and termination
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We may, at any time and for any reason, terminate your access to the
          Services, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate your
          account. In the event of termination, your account will be disabled
          and you may not be granted access to your account or any Content
          therein.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">
          Limitation of liability
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          [iTravel] or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss
          of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Services, third-party software and/or third-party
          hardware used with the Services, or otherwise in connection with any
          provision of this Agreement), even if [iTravel] or any supplier has
          been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
          fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion
          or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
          limitation and exclusions may not apply to you.
